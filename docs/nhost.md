  Nhost.io is a full-fledged serverless backend for Jamstack and client-serverless applications. 
  It enables developers to build dynamic websites without having to worry about infrastructure, 
  data storage, data access and user management.
  Nhost was inspired by Google Firebase, but uses SQL, GraphQL and has no vendor lock-in.
 
  Or simply put, it's an open source firebase alternative with GraphQL, which allows 
  passionate developers to build apps fast without managing infrastructure - from MVP to global scale.
