  \ \n\n  Nhost is a full-fledged serverless backend for Jamstack and client-serverless
  applications. \n  It enables developers to build dynamic websites without having
  to worry about infrastructure, \n  data storage, data access and user management.\n
  \ Nhost was inspired by Google Firebase, but uses SQL, GraphQL and has no vendor
  lock-in.\n \n  Or simply put, it's an open source firebase alternative with GraphQL,
  which allows \n  passionate developers to build apps fast without managing infrastructure
  - from MVP to global scale.\n  "
